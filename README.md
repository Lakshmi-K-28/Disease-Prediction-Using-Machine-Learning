# Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts diseases based on patient symptoms using multiple machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Naive Bayes. It includes data preprocessing, class balancing with RandomOverSampler, model evaluation with Stratified K-Fold, and an ensemble approach for robust predictions.
